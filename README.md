I hate IFunny ads! They're annoying or straight up illegal. I spent quite a while blocking domains using lockdown privacy and have succeeded! Here are all of the domains and the easy-to-use code for blocking ads on IFunny! Note that you'll need to run a BadKB script so you'll have to do some research for your own tools (I have a flipper zero)

There are two files, the text file of the URLs and the BadKB script for Lockdown Privacy

You will need to setup some way to run the BadKB script if you want to use it

As of 4/16/2024 this blocks everything

The script takes about 20-25 minutes due to the delays that I put in the code to compensate for lag. You essentially just need to spam the "+" button every 5 seconds until the code is done but it beats paying $14 a month for a minimal blocker
